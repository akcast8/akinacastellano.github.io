            Hi my name is Akina. I’ve received my Bachelor’s in Computer Science, and I’m passionate 
            about software engineering, AI agents, and game development. I build apps, intelligent systems, 
            and interactive experiences.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Physical Diagnosis App (Melanoma Awareness & Screening Tool)</h3>
            <p> Developed a mobile application in collaboration with an Emory University physician 
                to promote melanoma awareness and support early skin cancer detection through image-based 
                screening and educational resources. The app combines machine learning-powered analysis 
                with guided clinical assessment to help users make informed health decisions.

            <h4>Tech Stack:</h4>
            <p>Swift, Xcode, Apple Create ML, Firebase, iOS SDK, Jira</p>

            <h4>Key Features:</h4>
            <p>- Machine learning-based skin image scanning that evaluates potential melanoma severity and 
                provides personalized recommendations</p>
            <p>- Image upload and scan history tracking to monitor skin changes over time</p>
            <p>- ABCDE melanoma assessment checklist integrated with image analysis</p>
            <p>- Educational resource hub with medically reviewed melanoma information</p>
            <p>- “Find Medical Professionals Nearby” feature to support follow-up care</p>
            <p>- Secure, user-specific data storage using Firebase</p>

            <h4>What I Did:</h4>
            <p>- Designed and implemented core iOS features in Swift, including the ABCDE Checklist View 
                and scan history tracking system</p>
            <p>- Integrated Apple Create ML models to support image-based melanoma screening</p>
            <p>- Build Firebase-backed user data storage for scan records and image comparisons</p>
            <p>- Researched and incorporated trusted clinical content (e.g., Mayo Clinic guidelines) into the educational section</p>
            <p>- Collaborated cross-functionally with a physician and team members using Jira for task management</p>
            <p>- Helped present the project at Expo, where it earned 3rd Place for innovation and impact</p>
