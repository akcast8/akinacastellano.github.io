            <h2>Physical Diagnosis App (Melanoma Awareness & Screening Tool)</h3>
            <p> Developed a mobile application in collaboration with an Emory University physician 
                to promote melanoma awareness and support early skin cancer detection through image-based 
                screening and educational resources. The app combines machine learning-powered analysis 
                with guided clinical assessment to help users make informed health decisions.
