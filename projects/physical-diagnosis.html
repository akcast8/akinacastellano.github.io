    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p> Developed a mobile application in collaboration with an Emory University physician to promote melanoma awareness and 
        support early skin cancer detection through image-based screening and educational resources. The app combines machine 
        learning-powered analysis with guided clinical assessment to help users make informed health decisions.
